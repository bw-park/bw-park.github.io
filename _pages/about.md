I am pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in artificial intelligence at KAIST advised by Professor [Juho Lee](https://juho-lee.github.io/). My primary **research interest** is on **Stochastic Optimal Control**, with practical applications in generative models, state space models, and variational inference. I aim to leverage these areas to enhance theoretical insights and develop large-scale applications.
