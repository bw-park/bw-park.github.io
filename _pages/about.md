I am pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in artificial intelligence at KAIST advised by Professor [Juho Lee](https://juho-lee.github.io/). My primary **research interests** are in generative models, state space models, and variational inference utilizing **stochastic optimal control**, with the goal of developing practical applications grounded in a thorough theoretical understanding.
