Hi, I am a Master student at KAIST advised by Professor [Juho Lee](https://juho-lee.github.io/).

**Research Interest**: My research interest lies in the probabilistic modeling and exploring its application across diverse domains. By establishing links between these frameworks and their practical implementations in the domains of machine learning, I aim to contribute to the advancement of these fields.

- **Generative Models**
- **State Space Models**
- **Variational Inference**
- **Stochastic Optimal Control**
