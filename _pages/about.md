**Research Interest**: My research interest lies in the probabilistic modeling and exploring its application across diverse domains. Drawing inspiration from mathematical and statistical developments like
- **Bayesian Statistics**
- **Sequential Monte Carlo**
- **Stochasic Differential Equation**
- **Stochastic Optimal Control**

By establishing links between these frameworks and their practical implementations in the domains of machine learning and artificial intelligence (ML/AI), I aim to contribute to the advancement of these fields.
