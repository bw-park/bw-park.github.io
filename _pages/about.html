<p>I am pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in artificial intelligence at KAIST advised by Professor <a href="https://juho-lee.github.io/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Juho Lee</a>. My primary <strong>research interest</strong> is on <strong>Stochastic Optimal Control</strong>, with practical applications in generative models, state space models, and variational inference. I aim to leverage these areas to enhance theoretical insights and develop large-scale applications.</p>
